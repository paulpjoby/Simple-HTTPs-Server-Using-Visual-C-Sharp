## Simple-HTTPs-Server-Using-Visual-C-Sharp
Simple HTTPs Server. Just created one for Fun. Feel free to copy and use the code in any way you want :)

- SSL_Server is actually the root folder of your server.

### Self Signed Certificate and Key 

- `server.crt` - The sample certificate 
- `server.key` - The sample private key 

NOTE: As these files are available to anyone, the private keys are no longer private. They should be used for testing purposes only !

DO NOT USE THEM FOR A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT !
